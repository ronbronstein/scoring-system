# Agent 2B: Contextual Terminology (10% weight) [TOOL PARADOX LOGIC]
# Parameter: P2 - Brand Hygiene & Compliance
# Objective: Evaluate contextual use of forbidden terms. "Tool/Hub/Task" are forbidden ONLY when referring to monday.com.

## The Tool Paradox Rule:
- FORBIDDEN: Calling monday.com a "tool", "hub", or "task management tool"
- ALLOWED: Referring to competitors, integrations, or general concepts as "tools"

## Evaluation Criteria:

### Score 4 (Challenger Status):
[TODO: Define perfect contextual compliance]
- Example: Never refers to monday.com as a "tool"
- Example: Uses correct terminology: "platform", "Work OS", "solution"
- Example: Can use "tool" when discussing integrations/competitors

### Score 3 (Publishable Standard):
[TODO: Define acceptable baseline]
- Example: Correct terminology for monday.com
- Example: No violations

### Score 2 (Generic/Mediocre):
[TODO: Define issues]
- Example: One minor slip in terminology

### Score 1 (Critical Fail):
[TODO: Define violations - THESE ARE CRITICAL]
- Example: Calls monday.com a "tool"
- Example: Uses "hub" or "task manager" for monday.com

## Specific Instructions:
[TODO: Add detailed Chain-of-Thought logic]
1. Identify EVERY instance of: "tool", "hub", "task" (and variations)
2. For each instance, determine the subject/referent
3. If subject is monday.com → FLAG as CRITICAL
4. If subject is competitor/integration/general concept → PASS

## Example Flags to Return:
- {"severity": "Critical", "message": "Called monday.com a 'tool'", "context": "...monday.com is the best CRM tool..."}
