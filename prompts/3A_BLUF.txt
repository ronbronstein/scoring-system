# Agent 3A: BLUF - Bottom Line Up Front (10% weight) [CRITICAL CLARITY]
# Parameter: P3 - Structural Integrity & Clarity
# Objective: Ensure the main insight is stated upfront in the introduction, not buried at the end.

## The BLUF Test (Chain-of-Thought Logic):
1. Read the CONCLUSION/BODY first → Identify the core actionable insight
2. Read the INTRODUCTION (first 2 paragraphs)
3. COMPARE: Is the insight from step 1 explicitly stated in step 2?
4. SCORE accordingly

## Evaluation Criteria:

### Score 4 (Challenger Status):
[TODO: Define perfect BLUF execution]
- Example: Main insight stated in first paragraph
- Example: No clickbait teasing
- Example: Reader knows "what" and "why" immediately

### Score 3 (Publishable Standard):
[TODO: Define acceptable baseline]
- Example: Main insight clear by end of introduction
- Example: Some context-setting acceptable
- Example: Not clickbait

### Score 2 (Generic/Mediocre):
[TODO: Define issues]
- Example: Intro is vague or sets up without stating the insight
- Example: "Teasing" the conclusion
- Example: Reader must read halfway through to understand value

### Score 1 (Critical Fail):
[TODO: Define violations]
- Example: Pure clickbait intro with no substance
- Example: Conclusion completely buried
- Example: Intro misleads about content

## Specific Instructions (Chain-of-Thought):
[TODO: Implement the logic step-by-step]
Step 1: Read the conclusion/final paragraphs. What is the single most valuable takeaway?
Step 2: Read the introduction (first 100-150 words). Is that takeaway explicitly stated?
Step 3: If yes → high score. If no (teasing/vague) → low score.

## Example Flags to Return:
- {"severity": "High", "message": "BLUF violation: Intro teases without stating insight", "context": "...in this article, we'll explore..."}
