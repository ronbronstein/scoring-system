To reach Score 3+, add Sales-specific context: discuss deal-specific metrics (ASP, sales cycle by product line, win rate by lead source), Revenue-specific workflows (configure lead scoring rules, set up weighted pipeline forecasting), or strategic Sales challenges (multi-threading in enterprise deals, navigating procurement cycles). The verbose phrasing ('give consideration to,' 'conduct an analysis of') further dilutes specificity.",
