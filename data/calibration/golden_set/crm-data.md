## What is CRM Data?

Your CRM is home to all of the most important data that you need to track your leads, opportunities, current, and past customers. Think of it as a modern-day Roladex, but so much fancier and more sophisticated.

**CRM data** is all of the information that you keep relating to your clients in your CRM. This is anything from simple contact information, to tracking contact with your client, potential sales, tracking leads along the pipeline, and more. Let’s take a deeper look into the different types of data.

## 4 Types of CRM Data You Should Know About

### Identity data

This is all of the information you need to identify and stay in touch, with your leads and contacts. Identity data includes **name, address, phone number, email, links to relevant social media channels, birthdays, company information**, and anything else relevant to your interaction with the (potential) client.

### Descriptive data

This type of data gives you a deeper understanding of your leads and contacts so that you can connect with them better. This type of data may include information about a contact’s **family details, lifestyle information, educational background, workplace experience**, etc.

### Quantitative data

Here are where the numbers come into the CRM equation. Quantitative data that you’ll want to include in your CRM includes **purchases** that a client has made, **engagement on social media, contact points** along the way (meetings, emails), **service tickets** they have filed, and more.

### Qualitative data

Qualitative data is often gathered from your contact directly and can include information relating to their thoughts on your company and its customer service, satisfaction with products that they have purchased, who things were purchased for, etc. This data can help you gain a broader understanding of who your clients are and why they are purchasing your product specifically.

## Top Ways to Structure Your CRM Data

Once you’ve added in the correct data, it’s time to create the right structure for your CRM. Without the right structure in place, your data is likely to get lost in the shuffle and you won’t be able to gather actionable insights to improve your work.

We recommend structuring your CRM in stages:

### Lifecycle stage

This stage looks at where your lead or contact is in the sales funnel or sales readiness. These categories can include:

* Leads
* Qualified Leads
* Opportunities
* Customers
* And others

The goal is to move contacts down the sales pipeline into paying customers and to gain visibility into where they may be potentially getting stuck along the way.

### Lead status

This is a more specific look into where your qualified leads are in the sales process. As each phase requires specific care and attention, you can set up automation to work with clients no matter if they are in the:

* New
* In Progress
* Open Deal
* Attempted to Contact
* Connected
* Or any other status

### Other customized needs

At the end of the day, a CRM needs to fit the specific needs of your company and the way that you sell. This means that you’ll most likely need to have the opportunity to create customized categories and phases to track the data you need to create a winning sales strategy.

## The Benefits of Limiting CRM Data to Essential Information

To put it short: no one wants to get lost inside their CRM. And too much data can cause this to happen.

**Quality over quantity** is definitely the mindset that you should have when approaching your CRM setup. Think about what goals you are trying to achieve and how the data you are inputting will help you achieve them.

If you add too much data, you may start tracking information that won’t advance you toward your goals.

## Best Practices for CRM Data Collection and Management

Ready to start collecting data? Here are a few best practices:

* **Keep data relevant.** As mentioned, choose which data you will collect wisely so that you can remain focused.
* **Make your CRM your single source of data.** This means keeping your team on board with the CRM and tracking all relevant data inside the specific program. If data is scattered, it is harder to track and then your CRM will lose value.
* **Chose a CRM that is mobile-friendly.** Your salespeople aren’t always at their computers. By choosing a CRM that you can access from a phone, tablet, or computer, you’ll be able to boost accuracy by adding data in real time.
* **Set up dashboards to stay on track and gain quick insights.** CRM software today like monday sales CRM give you the chance to create dashboards for a quick view of relevant data.
