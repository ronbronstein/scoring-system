## 4 steps to boost revenue with customer feedback analysis

To help you get started, here is an easy-to-follow, four-step process to boost revenue with customer feedback analysis.

### Step 1: Lean on CRM for easy analysis

With a CRM system, you can pull together all this insight into one central location — crucial when running comprehensive and thorough customer feedback analysis. Actually, CRMs can even help you to run the customer feedback analysis.

Here’s how:

* **Categorize feedback:** CRMs make it quick and easy to create and assign categories to data. With some clever CRM systems, you can sort customer feedback into different categories, like product suggestions, support issues, and complaints.
* **Segment data:** With a CRM, you can slice and dice your customer data. For example, you can look at feedback and pricing history. This all makes it easier to analyze feedback by specific customer segments and then more easily identify trends in the data.
* **Automate analysis:** Some CRMs even feature built-in analytics tools like sentiment analysis. This allows businesses to identify themes in customer feedback.

CRM systems centralize customer feedback in one place, and even run customer feedback analysis for you. Presenting it in an easy-to-digest visual report for all teams to use.

### Step 2: Consider data capture

There are so many ways to capture this insight, thanks to the multiple communication channels we now have available. Some require direct contact with the customer, others focus on analyzing customer journeys.

Here are just a handful of examples:

* **Surveys and quizzes:** These are probably the most popular. They can be quick and easy to do. Plus, they can be shared via email, in person and can include open-ended questions and gamification techniques.
* **Net Promoter Scores (NPS):** With an NPS approach, you ultimately find out if customers would recommend your brand.
* **Customer interviews or focus groups:** This one’s not for every business as it can be resource-intensive. These capture more in-depth feedback and allow the business to ask questions to find out more.
* **Online reviews:** Sites like TrustPilot, TripAdvisor, and even Google reviews provide valuable feedback — even if it IS sometimes negative.
* **Website analytics:** This one doesn’t require customer input. It focuses on analyzing website traffic, bounce rates, and time spent on site to understand customer behavior and preferences.

Now, this may be daunting. How is it possible to capture and piece together all this insight to then run customer feedback analysis? The simple answer is this: A really good CRM software.
