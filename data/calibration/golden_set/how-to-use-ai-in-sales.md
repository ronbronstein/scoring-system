## 12 ways to use AI in your sales workflows

AI has evolved from a sales trend into a practical powerhouse, particularly for B2B sales teams. According to research by McKinsey, automation and AI can help free up about 20% of a sales team’s capacity. With all that extra time, sales teams can work towards exceeding quotas, building more solid customer relationships, and nurturing every lead. Below, we’ll look at how to use AI in B2B sales with 12 practical ways to apply it to your sales workflows.

### 1. Draft personalized outreach emails in seconds

Writing personalized messages at scale is one of the most time-consuming parts of sales, yet personalization is key. According to McKinsey, personalizing sales and marketing experiences leads to an improvement of 15-30% in revenue and retention. AI can generate tailored emails based on deal stage, customer profile, and previous interactions so that reps can engage prospects without spending hours writing dozens or even hundreds of messages from scratch.

For example, a rep following up on a lead could use AI to personalize an email that references a lead’s industry, adjust the tone for a C-suite audience, and insert a call-to-action to schedule a product demo. When using a platform like monday CRM with built-in AI writing assistance, reps can edit and send email drafts directly from the CRM without switching tools.

### 2. Auto-summarize meetings and follow-ups

After a long sales call, it’s easy to forget key details or delay next steps while scrambling to take notes. AI can instantly analyze call transcripts, email threads, or meetings and generate structured summaries with action items.

With AI-generated summarization, sales reps can quickly review key takeaways, decisions, action items, and understand next steps without digging through lengthy conversations. Then, reps can share key talking points with stakeholders without rewatching the call or scanning lengthy threads. AI summarization capabilities are embedded in the monday CRM platform so that the entire team stays synced.

### 3. Generate sales quotes and invoices on demand

When a deal progresses quickly, reps don’t want to lose momentum by formatting a quote or building invoices from scratch. AI can automatically create professional sales documents using details already in your CRM, like pricing and client info.

For instance, if a deal record includes a selected product tier, timeline, and company name, AI can instantly generate a branded quote with pre-filled values and suggested payment terms. With just a click, the rep can send it to the client and keep the deal moving. Teams that use monday CRM can generate these documents with built-in AI tools so that they don’t need to fiddle with manually formatting invoices and quotes.

### 4. Route and enrich incoming leads

New leads often come in with incomplete information or get stuck in the wrong pipeline. AI can make lead management easier by filling in the blanks, like company size, industry, or contact role, and route leads to the right team member based on priority or territory.

If a new contact completes a web form with just a name and email, AI-powered lead enrichment software can update that record with additional data like LinkedIn profile and firmographics. Then, the lead gets assigned to the right sales rep based on custom parameters, like skill level, territory, or availability, all without any manual work.

### 5. Suggest the next best action for every deal

Sometimes, reps have dozens of active deals, which makes it tricky to know exactly what to prioritize. AI can analyze historical deal patterns, past communication, and customer behavior to recommend next steps tailored to each opportunity.

For example, if a deal has been idle for 10 or more days, AI might suggest re-engaging the prospect by sending them a case study or nudging with a pricing incentive based on similar won deals. If you’re using monday CRM, built-in AI agents are ready to give you these nudges right in the platform by suggesting next steps or drafting emails to re-engage leads.

### 6. Create custom sales content for any stage

Whether it’s a sales deck, product summary, or follow-up email, reps need content that matches the buyer’s context. AI makes it easier to generate or repurpose assets without reinventing the wheel every time. Sales teams can prompt AI to generate personalized pitch content for specific personas, industries, or stages of the funnel and even convert longer assets into social posts or one-pagers.

Personalizing content with AI can drastically improve the customer experience since prospects receive messaging that directly addresses their specific pain points, industry challenges, and business goals rather than generic, one-size-fits-all materials. With monday CRM, these assets can be created and stored right within each deal so that the entire team has access to them.

### 7. Fill in CRM fields faster with AI

Sales reps often spend valuable time logging notes, summarizing meetings, or adding deal context to CRM fields. Reps can use a CRM with AI to analyze communication history and generate relevant inputs automatically.

A sales agent could ask AI to summarize a discovery call and generate a one-line description for the deal card, add follow-up tasks, highlight important dates, and auto-tag the opportunity based on the customer’s expressed pain points. It can also extract key details like budget ranges, decision timelines, and stakeholder names mentioned during conversations, automatically populating CRM fields without manual data entry.

### 8. Recap entire deal timelines in one click

Jumping back into a deal after weeks away? AI can generate a high-level timeline summary so reps can review what’s happened and pick up exactly where they left off. AI timeline summaries also make collaboration a lot easier between reps, as anyone can click on a deal and get up to speed without reading through dozens of emails and call logs.

These summaries synthesize activities, communications, and status updates into a concise, chronological view embedded within the deal board, helping reps and managers stay in sync. With the AI Timeline Summary in monday CRM, reps can visualize AI-generated summaries that eliminate the need to manually dig through status updates.

### 9. Prioritize leads with intelligent scoring

Not all leads are created equal. AI can assess historical conversion rates, engagement behavior, and company data to score leads based on their likelihood to convert.

If you’re wondering how to use AI in B2B sales specifically, this is one of the most impactful applications. In B2B, where deals are complex and sales cycles are long, AI-powered lead scoring helps teams focus on the right opportunities at the right time. For example, a lead who opens multiple emails, visits your pricing page, and shares traits with previously closed deals would automatically rise to the top of the queue.

With monday CRM, users can integrate this logic directly into their lead boards using AI-assisted workflows and scoring rules — no spreadsheet wrangling required.

### 10. Save time with meeting recaps and sentiment analysis

Instead of rewatching a call or reading through notes, reps can rely on AI to deliver a clean, structured meeting recap. These summaries capture key points, objections, decisions, and agreed-upon next steps.

Once generated, the recap can be added to the deal, shared with managers, or used to trigger automated follow-up workflows. AI can also identify sentiment changes throughout meetings and historically in emails and messages, flagging when prospects seem hesitant or excited about certain topics. This allows sales teams to tailor their follow-up approach accordingly, whether that means addressing specific concerns or capitalizing on areas of high interest to accelerate the sale.

### 11. Turn updates into task lists automatically

A single update often contains multiple next steps, but reps don’t always have time to turn notes into a task list. AI can break down a conversation or meeting summary into specific action items.

Reps can create tasks like “send pricing sheet,” “schedule follow-up call,” or “loop in tech support.” Then, assign tasks automatically to keep the sales motion moving without manual tracking. AI can even set priority levels and due dates to each task based on deal urgency or client requirements mentioned in the conversation.

### 12. Improve handoffs with smart deal summaries

When ownership of a deal changes from BDR to AE or AE to success, for example, context is everything. AI-generated summaries can provide the full picture, so transitions are seamless. A smart handoff summary might include the last interaction, client objections, pricing discussed, decision-makers involved, and current stage, all delivered in one clean update.

AI can also highlight a prospect’s communication preferences, buying timeline, and any red flags or urgent priorities that emerged in previous conversations. Smart summaries provide context and prevent new sales reps from having to rebuild rapport or ask redundant questions that could frustrate prospects. With a CRM like monday CRM, handoffs are smooth thanks to AI-generated summaries built into the handoff flow.
