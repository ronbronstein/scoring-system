## What is sales productivity?

Sales productivity describes the relationship between a salesperson’s efficiency and effectiveness. Let’s take a look at the difference between these two terms in more detail:

* **Effectiveness:** The number of people a sales rep converts into paying customers.
* **Efficiency:** How quickly a sales rep can complete a task with minimal resources.

Ultimately, sales productivity is a way to track how much a salesperson sells in comparison to how many resources they use to make the sale.

## 5 ways to optimize your team’s sales productivity

There are a number of factors that can impact a person’s sales productivity. These include goals, quality of leads, tools available, and more. Optimizing these factors is key for businesses that want to increase their reps’ sales productivity. Here’s how:

### 1. Use a CRM for sales

A customer relationship management (CRM) tool allows companies to store and track all communications with customers — and nurture them along the funnel. Ultimately, this helps sales teams convert more leads into customers in less time. A CRM comes with features like:

* Create detailed customer profiles
* Analyze data and trends in customer behavior
* Track leads and conversations
* Measure progress and results with reporting and analytics

Moreover, a CRM provides a centralized database that can be accessed anytime and anywhere. This makes it easier for sales reps to connect with multiple customers in different timezones — leading to increased engagement in conversations and higher conversion rates.

### 2. Set daily goals

If you set daily goals that are challenging but achievable, it becomes easier for sales reps to see progress and stay motivated. When creating goals, keep in mind factors like workload and resources available — to ensure team members can complete their tasks on time.

Additionally, it’s important to put in place concrete systems that monitor your reps’ progress to help hold them accountable. This can include tracking milestones such as the number of calls, emails sent, or total sales.

At the same time, provide feedback about incremental wins and have regular meetings to make sure everyone meets their target number.

### 3. Gather high-quality leads

Generating high-quality leads allows sales teams to narrow down their pool of target customers and only focus on those who are likely to convert quickly. This in turn frees up more resources to dedicate to the actual sales process — due to fewer efforts being wasted on unqualified leads that don’t match up with your company’s target demographics.

Overall, this leads to a shorter sales cycle, more revenue, and fewer resources spent.

### 4. Improve sales team onboarding and training

Without an effective onboarding and training program, sales teams will take longer to reach full productivity. In contrast, by providing resources and support during this stage, businesses can create cohesive sales teams that are far more efficient and effective. A well-structured onboarding program should include information about:

* Target market
* Products or services offered
* Latest sales techniques
* Workflows and processes

### 5. Align sales and marketing

Data shows that businesses with effective sales and marketing alignment achieve **208%** higher revenue. This is because they provide one another with critical insights that boost the performances of all team members. For example, sales teams can accept marketing-qualified leads — allowing them to focus their efforts on more valuable prospects instead of those that aren’t ready to buy.

The best way to align your marketing and sales team is to meet often, set shared goals, share analysis and reporting, and more .

## What sales productivity metrics should you track?

Monitoring specific metrics allows teams to better understand their performance and how they can improve their sales productivity. Here are five to keep in mind:

* **Conversion rate:** How successful a team is at transforming leads into paying customers.
* **Win rate:** Measure the number of deals that are won compared to total sales opportunities.
* **Pipeline waterfall:** Quantifiable and granular view of how deals are progressing.
* **Average deal size:** Important insights into how profitable each sale is.
* **Customer retention rate:** The number of customers that continue to pay for and use your product or service.
