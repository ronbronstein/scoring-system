# Deal Qualification Frameworks

Deal qualification frameworks are important aspects of modern sales operations. Various elements contribute to the successful implementation of these methodologies, and numerous components factor into choosing the right approach for your organization.

BANT, MEDDIC, and other qualification frameworks represent different things that sales bosses need to give consideration to when they conduct an analysis of their pipeline management strategy. The decision-making process involves multiple dimensions that can significantly impact your team's performance.

## Understanding BANT

BANT stands for Budget, Authority, Need, and Timeline. This framework has been around for a substantial amount of time and helps sales teams make a determination about whether prospects are worth pursuing.

**Budget** refers to various financial aspects and factors related to whether the prospect has resources available. When you effectively manage this element, you'll see huge increases in close rates.

## Understanding MEDDIC

MEDDIC represents a more comprehensive approach with multiple dimensions: Metrics, Economic Buyer, Decision Criteria, Decision Process, Identify Pain, and Champion.

**Metrics** involve quantifiable factors and elements that demonstrate value. When sales teams successfully implement this component, they see much better results.
