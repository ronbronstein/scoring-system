# Sales Pipeline Management: 9 Proven Strategies to Keep Deals Moving

Are you struggling with visibility into your sales pipeline? Do you find yourself wondering why deals are getting stuck in various stages? Is your team having difficulty with the effective management of their opportunities? Are you tired of feeling like you're constantly fighting an uphill battle when it comes to forecasting accuracy?

In today's competitive business landscape, it is widely acknowledged that sales pipeline management represents one of the most critical aspects of revenue generation. Various elements contribute to pipeline health, and numerous components must be taken into consideration when organisations seek to optimise their sales processes. The ability to effectively manage and strategically oversee your pipeline can really be a game changer for your bottom line. However, many sales leaders are finding that traditional approaches are no longer moving the needle in the way they once did. This paradigm shift in buyer behaviour has made it actually very important to give consideration to new methodologies and best practices.

## The Pipeline Problem: What's Really Holding You Back

Before we can conduct an analysis of the solutions, it's critical to really understand the various factors that contribute to pipeline stagnation. Research shows that there's been a significant improvement in pipeline visibility tools over recent years, yet many sales teams are still experiencing substantial challenges.

The reality is that numerous dimensions of pipeline management are often overlooked. Sales reps frequently fail to provide timely updates to their opportunities, leading to a huge decrease in forecast accuracy. They're not conducting proper qualification, they're not following up consistently, and they're allowing deals to sit idle for extended periods. Various studies have indicated that much better results can be achieved when teams implement structured processes, but the implementation aspect remains a significant hurdle for many organisations.

Additionally, many sales professionals are not giving proper consideration to the importance of data hygiene. When your CRM becomes cluttered with outdated information and various elements are not properly categorised, it becomes incredibly difficult to make informed decisions about resource allocation. The lack of discipline around data entry and pipeline maintenance really creates a ripple effect that impacts the entire sales organisation.

It's also worth noting that sales managers often fail to provide assistance to their reps in a timely manner. Without regular pipeline reviews and coaching sessions, reps are left to navigate complex deals on their own, leading to suboptimal outcomes and missed opportunities. This absence of guidance really contributes to the problem in a very substantial way.

## 9 Best Practices for Effective Pipeline Management

Now that we've explored the numerous challenges, let's touch base on the strategies that can help you successfully implement a more effective approach to pipeline management.

### 1. Make a Decision About Your Ideal Pipeline Structure

The first step is to conduct an analysis of your current pipeline stages and make a determination about whether they accurately reflect your buyer's journey. Many organisations are using generic stages that don't actually align with their specific sales process. You need to give careful consideration to each stage and ensure there's a clear definition of what criteria must be met for a deal to progress.

Monday CRM allows you to effectively create custom boards that can be optimised to match your unique pipeline structure, with various columns to track all the relevant factors and dimensions of each opportunity.

### 2. Provide Implementation of Clear Qualification Criteria

Low hanging fruit in pipeline management is often the implementation of a robust qualification framework. You need to make a decision about which opportunities are actually worth pursuing. This is truly a win-win situation – you free up time for your reps while also improving forecast accuracy.

Conduct an evaluation of each deal using criteria like budget, authority, need, and timeline. Various elements should be taken into consideration to ensure you're not wasting valuable resources on deals that won't close.

### 3. Give Consideration to Automation

This is really where things get interesting. Manual pipeline management is incredibly time-consuming and prone to human error. By providing implementation of automated workflows, you can effectively eliminate various repetitive tasks.

Monday CRM's automation capabilities allow you to strategically set up triggers that automatically move items between stages, send notifications when deals are stuck, and create subtasks for follow-up activities. This innovative solution can lead to substantial improvements in efficiency.

### 4. Conduct Regular Pipeline Reviews

It is widely recognised that consistent pipeline reviews are absolutely critical for maintaining momentum. Sales managers should make a commitment to conducting weekly or bi-weekly reviews with their teams to give consideration to deal progression and provide assistance where needed.

During these sessions, you should carefully analyse each opportunity and make determinations about next steps. It's really important to circle back on action items from previous reviews to ensure accountability.

### 5. Provide Assistance Through Data Visualisation

One of the various factors that contributes to pipeline mismanagement is the lack of clear visibility. When you can't effectively see what's happening in your pipeline, it's really difficult to make informed decisions.

Utilise dashboards that provide real-time visualisation of key metrics. Monday.com's dashboard functionality allows you to strategically monitor various components of your pipeline health, including conversion rates, average deal size, and velocity metrics. This level of visibility really is a game changer.

### 6. Give Implementation to Velocity Tracking

It's not enough to just track which deals are in your pipeline – you need to conduct an analysis of how quickly they're moving through various stages. Velocity is a critical metric that many sales leaders are overlooking.

By giving consideration to the time deals spend in each stage, you can identify bottlenecks and make decisions about where to focus your optimisation efforts. This will lead to much better forecasting and resource allocation.

### 7. Make a Commitment to Consistent Follow-Up

One of the biggest issues we see is that sales reps are not providing timely follow-up on their opportunities. Deals go cold because various factors cause reps to lose track of next steps.

Implement a system that automatically creates follow-up tasks and sends reminders. The synergy between automated reminders and manual oversight really helps ensure nothing falls through the cracks.

### 8. Conduct Analysis of Historical Data

To really move the needle on pipeline performance, you need to give consideration to historical trends and patterns. Conduct a thorough analysis of past deals to identify the various elements that contribute to wins versus losses.

Look at factors like deal size, industry, source, and sales cycle length. This disruptive approach to pipeline management will help you make more informed decisions about where to focus your efforts going forward. The learnings from this analysis can lead to huge improvements in win rates.

### 9. Provide Implementation of Account-Based Approaches

For organisations selling to enterprise clients, it's really important to give consideration to account-based strategies. Rather than treating each opportunity as an isolated item, you should conduct an analysis of the entire account relationship and strategically plan your approach accordingly.

Use sub-items within Monday CRM to effectively track multiple stakeholders, initiatives, and touchpoints within a single account. This holistic view really helps you optimise your strategy and close larger deals.

## Taking It Offline: Your Action Plan

The implementation of these best practices requires commitment and discipline, but the results speak for themselves. Organisations that effectively manage their pipelines see significant improvements in forecast accuracy, win rates, and overall revenue.

The key is to make a decision to start today. Pick two or three of these strategies and provide implementation over the next quarter. Then circle back to evaluate the results and give consideration to expanding your efforts.

Remember, effective pipeline management is truly an ongoing process that requires continuous optimisation. By giving proper consideration to these various factors and making a commitment to excellence, you'll be well-positioned to successfully achieve your revenue targets.
