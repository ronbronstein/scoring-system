## What is a simple CRM?

A CRM is software that helps track information, communications, and interactions between your organization and your customers or leads.

A CRM app stores, organizes, and retrieves interactions between your team and customers or prospects, so anyone in your organization can retrieve and review every touchpoint you had with existing or potential customers. This ensures interactions with customers are always consistent and personalized, which in turn increases the chances of conversion and fosters stronger customer trust and loyalty.

Simple CRMs are platforms that include the premium features needed to manage and maintain customer relationships while still being easy to use, intuitive, and flexible.

There’s a wide range of software to choose from. Some simple CRMs are focused on just a few standout features, while others offer a full suite of functionalities like marketing features, unlimited contacts, customizable dashboards, chat features, and more, yet still retain their simplicity.

## Essential CRM features to look for

Many platforms come with tons of bells and whistles – not all of which are essential for every business. When it comes to choosing a simple CRM for your organization, there are a few key features you should look for. Make sure these features are front and center in a CRM solution and are clear and easy to use.

### 1\. Contact management

Your business needs a way to manage all customer and prospect details ― email addresses, cell numbers, postal addresses, and so on. A CRM organizes all of this information into one tidy database, letting you easily share information with your team. Most CRMs today are cloud-hosted, so you can use them on the go.

### 2\. Interaction tracking

Sales is a numbers game, it takes multiple touchpoints with a prospect to close a deal. If you record all interactions, team members can see what’s been done. Also, once prospects are converted into customers, your support team can offer more personalized service based on previous interactions. They’re quickly up to speed with requirements and can look after the customer and fulfill the order, follow up, and eventually pitch further orders and upsells.

### 3\. Automated notifications and reminders

A CRM is a one-stop solution for scheduling, reminders, and reviewing prior interaction details. Look for a simple CRM where these tools are simple to use and can be automated so that all these small manual tasks are taken off your shoulders, enabling your team to focus on nurturing leads and building relationships.

### 4\. Pipeline monitoring

A CRM isn’t just for access to customer data. You’ll also want it to handle other team processes, such as sales funnel management and order processing. Understanding how leads progress through your sales pipeline and when orders will drop lets you plan resources, organize your team, and improve campaigns and sales strategies.

## How to implement a simple CRM solution in your business

Introducing a new platform like a CRM to your company can help you improve business processes and work more productively, but if you’re not ready with an implementation plan, new software can have the opposite effect. To make the most of a new CRM, make sure you’re integrating it intentionally by following an implementation plan. Here are some steps to consider:

  * **Identify your needs** in a CRM, such as tracking sales, managing contacts, or automating workflows, and make sure to look for a platform that aligns with these goals.
  * **Select the right CRM** by comparing different options based on sales features, pricing, and ease of use.
  * **Import your essential data** like customer information, leads, workflows, and important documentation into the CRM to make sure everything is in one place.
  * **Personalize your CRM** with customizable dashboards, pipelines, workflows, and automation tools to stay in line with your existing procedures.
  * **Train your team** on an ongoing basis to make sure everyone understands how to make the most of new CRM software.
  * **Monitor and optimize** the performance of your CRM by examining employee feedback, ROI, and whether the platform has helped your company reach its goals.
